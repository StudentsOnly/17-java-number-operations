## Exercise: ArrayList Operations - Numbers

### Objective:
Practice basic ArrayList operations by working with a list of numbers.

### Description:
You are tasked with creating a program that performs basic operations on a list of numbers stored in an ArrayList. The program should allow users to add numbers, find the largest number, find the smallest number, and calculate the average of all numbers.

### Guidelines:

1.	Create an ArrayList to store integers.
2.	Implement a loop that displays a menu with the following options:
3.	Add a number
4.	Find the largest number
5.	Find the smallest number
6.	Calculate the average
7.	Exit

Depending on the selected option, perform the following tasks:

- To add a number, take input from the user and add it to the ArrayList.
- To find the largest number, iterate through the ArrayList and keep track of the maximum value.
- To find the smallest number, iterate through the ArrayList and keep track of the minimum value.
- To calculate the average, sum up all the numbers and divide by the count of numbers.
- To exit, terminate the program.
- Handle input validation to prevent errors when adding numbers and handling menu options.
